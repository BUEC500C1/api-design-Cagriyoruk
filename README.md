# Weather for Airport api-design-Cagriyoruk
api-design-Cagriyoruk created by GitHub Classroom

For all USA Airports, Develop an API and module where we can get current weather conditions for the airport asked by the API.

I created 2 functions in order to get the current weather conditions for the airport location. With first function get_airport, I get the airport location and with that I use it in the second function get_weather to get the current weather condition for the airport location. Then I output the information.

# Preparation
